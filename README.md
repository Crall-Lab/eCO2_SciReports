## Greenhouse CO<sub>2</sub> control
To record CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the study greenhouse chambers for experiment 2, we used Arduino UNOs linked to LiCor 8500 Gas Analyzers or Adafruit SCD-50 sensors. The code used to record CO<sub>2</sub> data from both sensors can be found in the [<b>eCO2_logger_licor_arduino.ino</b>](https://github.com/Crall-Lab/eCO2_SciReports/tree/d71c48e19f66539a5bbe0543b5ec497b8c47ddcb/eCO2_logger_licor_arduino) folder and to record CO<sub>2</sub> data from the Adafruit SCD-50 sensor only can be found in the [<b>aCO2_logger_arduino.ino</b>](https://github.com/Crall-Lab/eCO2_SciReports/tree/d71c48e19f66539a5bbe0543b5ec497b8c47ddcb/aCO2_logger_arduino) folder. 

To maintain the CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the eCO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse chambers, we used an Arduino UNO connected to the LiCor 8500 Gas Analyzer to take in current CO<sub>2</sub> readings and turn on and off a relay to the CO<sub>2</sub> regulator to increase the CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The code for this CO<sub>2</sub> controller can be found in the [<b>CO2_controller.ino</b>](https://github.com/Crall-Lab/eCO2_SciReports/tree/d71c48e19f66539a5bbe0543b5ec497b8c47ddcb/CO2_controller) folder.
