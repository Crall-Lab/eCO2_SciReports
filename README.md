# Datasets
Here is a list of the included data sets included here and used for analyses in the manuscript. 

1. <b>Metadata.xlsx</b> is the the metadata for all subsequent data files. Each file name is listed in bold with all column headings in column A and column descriptions, including units in column B. 
2. <b>CO2_log_exp1.csv</b> is the data file for the CO<sub>2</sub> logger data from experiment 1 containing time-stamped CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature readings for ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. 
3. <b>CO2_log_exp2.csv</b> is the data file for the CO<sub>2</sub> logger data from experiment 2 containing time-stamped CO<sub>2</sub>, humidity, and temperature readings for ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions in rounds 1 and 2. Outliers (high and low) are noted in a column so they can be removed for analyses.  
4. <b>Pollen_metabolomics_exp1.csv</b> is the data file containing the targeted metabolomics data from experiment 1. For each pollen sample, this data file records, the unique sample identifier, plant species, CO<sub>2</sub> treatment, sample type (pollen vs. anther), unique file name, the quanitities of 18 targeted compounds in each sample, and the experimental round each sample was from. 
5. <b>Pollen_chemistry_exp1.csv</b> contains pollen chemistry (%N, %C, C:N) data for experiment 1. For each pollen sample, this data file records the unique sample identifier, the plant species the sample came from, the CO<sub>2</sub> treatment, experimental round, %N and %C present in each sample, notes about the sample and a omit column to remove samples that were too low to be detected or duplicate samples. 
6. <b>Pollen_chemistry_exp2.csv</b> contains pollen chemistry (%N, %C, C:N) data for experiment 2. For each pollen sample, this data file records the unique sample identifier, the plant species the sample came from, the CO<sub>2</sub> treatment, experimental round, %N and %C present in each sample, notes about the sample and a omit column to remove samples that were too low to be detected or duplicate samples. 
7. <b>Biomass_exp2.csv</b>
8. <b>Flower_size_exp2.csv</b>
9. <b>Flowering_initiation_exp2.csv</b>
10. <b>Plant_growth_exp2.csv</b>

Code/Software

This is an optional, freeform section for describing any code in your submission and the software used to run it.

Describe any scripts, code, or notebooks (e.g., R, Python, Mathematica, MatLab) as well as the software versions (including loaded packages) that you used to run those files. If your repository contains more than one file whose relationship to other scripts is not obvious, provide information about the workflow that you used to run those scripts and notebooks.
